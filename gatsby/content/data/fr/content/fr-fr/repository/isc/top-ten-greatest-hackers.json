According to \u003ca href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/11/hacking-is-such-a-problem-that-the-cost-of-cyber-insurance-is-skyrocketing/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVenture Beat\u003c/a\u003e, the frequency of attacks on American companies has prompted a steep rise in the cost of cyber-insurance. Much of the problem stems from the advent of the internet, so amateur hackers can find all the tools they need online at virtually no cost. But this proliferation of hacking didn\u0027t emerge overnight—it took the work of the now-famous hackers to discover critical vulnerabilities and expose key weaknesses, establishing the foundation of a free-for-all Internet. Here\u0027s a look at the top ten most notorious hackers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003col class=\"ordered\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKevin Mitnick\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eA seminal figure in American hacking, \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/mitnick.background/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKevin Mitnick got his start as a teen\u003c/a\u003e. In 1981, he was charged with stealing computer manuals from Pacific Bell. In 1982 he hacked the North American Defense Command (NORAD), which inspired the 1983 film \"War Games.\" In 1989, he hacked Digital Equipment Corporation\u0027s (DEC) network and made copies of their software. Because DEC was a leading computer manufacturer at the time, this act put Mitnick on the map. He was later arrested, convicted and sent to prison. During his conditional release, he hacked Pacific Bell\u0027s voicemail systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout his hacking career, Mitnick didn\u0027t exploit the access and data he\u0027d obtained. While it\u0027s widely believed that he once obtained full control of Pacific Bell\u0027s network, Mitnik wasn\u0027t out to exploit the results, but wanted to prove it could be done. A warrant was issued for his arrest for the Pacific Bell incident, but he fled and was in hiding for more than two years. When caught, he went to prison for multiple counts of wire fraud and computer fraud. Mitnick ultimately went white hat, but according to \u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/09/kevin-mitnick-selling-zero-day-exploits/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWired\u003c/a\u003e, in 2014, he launched \"Mitnick\u0027s Absolute Zero Day Exploit Exchange,\" which sells unpatched, critical software exploits to the highest bidder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnonymous got its start in 2003 on 4chan message boards in an unnamed forum. The group exhibits little organization and is loosely focused on the concept of social justice. For example, in 2008 the group took issue with the Church of Scientology and begin disabling their websites, thus negatively impacting theirs search rankings in Google and overwhelming its fax machines with all-black images. In March 2008, a group of \"Anons\" marched passed Scientology centers around the world wearing the now-famous Guy Fawkes mask. As noted by \u003ca href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/masked-avengers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe New Yorker\u003c/a\u003e, while the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have tracked down some of the group\u0027s more prolific members, the lack of any real hierarchy makes it almost impossible to eliminate Anonymous as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdrian Lamo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2001, 20-year-old Adrian Lamo used an unprotected content management tool at Yahoo to modify a Reuters article and add a fake quote attributed to former Attorney General John Ashcroft. Often, Lamo would hack systems and then notify both the press and his victims — in some cases, he\u0027d help clean up the mess to improve their security. As \u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/05/lamo/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWired\u003c/a\u003e points out, however, Lamo took things too far in 2002, when he hacked The New York Times\u0027 intranet, added himself to the list of expert sources and began conducting research on high-profile public figures. Because he preferred to wander the streets with little more than a backpack and often had no fixed address, Lamo earned the moniker \"The Homeless Hacker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2010, 29-year-old Lamo learned he had Asperger\u0027s Disorder, a mild form of Autism often called \"geek syndrome\" because people with Asperger\u0027s have trouble with simple social interactions and display odd, highly focused behavior. Many experts believe this explains Lamo\u0027s entry into the world of hacking culture — Asperger\u0027s Disorder is reportedly prevalent among the hacking community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlbert Gonzalez\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/soupnazi-hacker-albert-gonzalez-nerdy-life-sex-guns-drugs-article-1.394977\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew York Daily News\u003c/a\u003e, Gonzalez, dubbed \"soupnazi,\" got his start as the \"troubled pack leader of computer nerds\" at his Miami high school. He eventually became active on criminal commerce site Shadowcrew.com and was considered one of its best hackers and moderators. At 22, Gonzalez was arrested in New York for debit card fraud related to stealing data from millions of card accounts. To avoid jail time, he became an informant for the Secret Service, ultimately helping indict dozens of Shadowcrew members.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring his time as a paid informant, Gonzalez, along with a group of accomplices, continued his criminal activities and stole more than 180 million payment card accounts from companies including OfficeMax, Dave and Buster\u0027s and Boston Market. \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14Hacker-t.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe New York Times Magazine\u003c/a\u003e notes that Gonzalez\u0027s 2005 attack on US retailer TJX was the first serial data breach of credit information. Using SQL injection, this famous hacker and his team created back doors in several corporate networks and stole an estimated $256 million from TJX alone. During his sentencing in 2015, the federal prosecutor called Gonzalez\u0027s human victimization \"unparalleled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMatthew Bevan and Richard Pryce\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eMatthew Bevan and Richard Pryce are a team of British hackers who hacked into multiple military networks in 1996, including Griffiss Air Force Base, the Defense Information System Agency and the Korean Atomic Research Institute (KARI). Bevan (Kuji) and Pryce (Datastream Cowboy) have been accused of nearly starting a third world war after they dumped KARI research onto American military systems. Bevan claims he was looking to prove a UFO conspiracy theory, and according to the \u003ca href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4761985.stm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBBC\u003c/a\u003e, his case bears resemblance to that of Gary McKinnon. Malicious intent or not, Bevan and Pryce demonstrated that even military networks are vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJeanson James Ancheta\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eJeanson James Ancheta had no interest in hacking systems for credit card data or crashing networks to deliver social justice. Instead, Ancheta was curious about the use of bots — software-based robots that can infect and ultimately control computer systems. Using a series of large-scale \"botnets,\" he was able to compromise more than 400,000 computers in 2005. According to \u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/05/6789-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArs Technica\u003c/a\u003e, he then rented these machines out to advertising companies and was also paid to directly install bots or adware on specific systems. Ancheta was given 57 months in prison, and his sentence marked the first time a hacker was sent to jail for the use of botnet technology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Calce\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn February 2000, 15-year-old Michael Calce, also known as \"Mafiaboy,\" discovered how to take over networks of university computers and used their combined resources to disrupt the number-one search engine at the time: Yahoo. Within a week, he\u0027d also brought down Dell, eBay, CNN and Amazon using a dedicated denial of service (DDoS) attack that overwhelmed corporate servers and caused websites to crash. Calce\u0027s wake-up call was perhaps the most jarring for investors and Internet proponents. If the biggest website in the world — valued at over $1 billion — could be so easily sidelined, was any online data truly safe? It\u0027s not an exaggeration to say that the development of cybercrime legislation suddenly became a top government priority thanks to Calce\u0027s hack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKevin Poulsen\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1983, a 17 year old Poulsen, using the alias Dark Dante, hacked into ARPANET, the Pentagon’s computer network, but was soon caught. The government decided not to prosecute Poulsen, who was a minor at the time and he was let off with a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoulsen didn’t heed this warning and continued hacking. In 1988, Poulsen hacked a federal computer and dug into files pertaining to the deposed president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos. Discovered by authorities, Poulsen went underground. While he was on the run, Poulsen kept busy, hacking government files and revealing secrets. According to his \u003ca href=\"https://www.kingpin.cc/about/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eown website\u003c/a\u003e, in 1990, he hacked a radio station contest and ensured that he was the 102nd caller, winning a brand new Porsche, a vacation, and $20,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaulsen was soon arrested and barred from using a computer for three years. He has since reinvented himself as a serious journalist, writing about computer security as the senior editor at \u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/author/kevin_poulsen/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWired\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJonathan James\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing the alias cOmrade, Jonathan James hacked into several companies. But according to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/23/us/youth-sentenced-in-government-hacking-case.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/a\u003e, what really earned him attention was his hack into the computers of the United States Department of Defense. What was all the more startling was that James was only 15 at the time. In \u003ca href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2164176,00.asp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ean interview with PC Mag\u003c/a\u003e, James admitted that he was partly inspired by the book The Cuckoo’s Egg, which details the hunt for a computer hacker in the 1980s. His hacking allowed him to access over three thousand messages from government employees, user names, passwords, and other sensitive data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJames was arrested in 2000 and was sentenced to a six months house arrest and banned from recreational computer use. However, a probation violation caused him to serve six months in jail. Jonathan James became the youngest person to be convicted of violating cybercrime laws.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2007, TJX, a department store, was hacked and many customer’s private information were compromised. Authorities suspected James might be involved despite a lack of evidence. Johnathan James eventually killed himself by gunshot in 2008. According to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2262831/Revealed-Aaron-Swartz-prosecutor-drove-hacker-suicide-2008-named-cyber-crime-case.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDaily Mail\u003c/a\u003e, James wrote in his \u003ca href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2262831/Revealed-Aaron-Swartz-prosecutor-drove-hacker-suicide-2008-named-cyber-crime-case.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esuicide note\u003c/a\u003e, “I have no faith in the \u0027justice\u0027 system.
