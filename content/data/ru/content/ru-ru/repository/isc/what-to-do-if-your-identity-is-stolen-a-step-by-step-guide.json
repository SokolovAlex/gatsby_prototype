Despite this issue\u0027s prevalence and the damage identity thieves can cause, many people aren\u0027t sure what to do when they become a victim of this crime.

While traditional identity theft involved criminals \"dumpster diving\" to obtain personal information such as receipts or credit card bills, thieves are now targeting popular online services. Banking websites, online retailers and even \u003ca href=\"http://www.csoonline.com/article/2980201/data-protection/ashley-madison-still-a-top-lure-for-scammers-and-crooks.html\"\u003edating sites\u003c/a\u003e hold a wealth of consumer information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eAs soon as you realize you\u0027ve been victimized (e.g., if new credit accounts have been opened in your name, purchases have been made without your consent or your contact information with government agencies has been altered), think about your recent online activity. Did you respond to any emails that appeared to be from financial institutions claiming that your account was suspended or under review? Did you download any video players or media files as attachments from senders you didn\u0027t know? Have any e-commerce sites you use on a regular basis recently sustained a cyberattack? Any one of these could create a vulnerability to hacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eTo limit your chance of exposure, ensure that you only ever log into banking websites using a secure connection, don\u0027t save your credit card information online and be careful about information you provide to any dating or meet-up sites. Also avoid using linked accounts and similar passwords as to not allow a cybercriminal to \u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\"\u003edaisy chain\u003c/a\u003e your information. Running a reliable antivirus solution is also critical, since detecting and removing malicious programs render their threats meaningless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e2) Start Making Calls\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eOnce you\u0027ve discovered the theft, start making calls. Begin with any companies where fraud occurred, such as your credit card issuer or bank. Ask them to close or freeze your accounts, and change all of your login and password information. Next, contact one of the \"big three\" credit bureaus:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.equifax.com/CreditReportAssistance/\"\u003eEquifax\u003c/a\u003e : 1-888-766-0008\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html\"\u003eExperian\u003c/a\u003e : 1-888-397-3742\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.transunion.com/fraud\"\u003eTransUnion\u003c/a\u003e : 1-800-680-7289\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eAsk for a credit report, and have a \"fraud alert\" placed on your accounts for 90 days. Once you\u0027ve contacted one of these agencies, they\u0027re obligated to inform the other two. Then, report the identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and file a police report with your local law enforcement department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fztuohj3Fck\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"292.5\" frameborder=\"0\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eunwanted text\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003ch2 xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e3) Cover Your Bases\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003ePrivate companies and government agencies often act quickly to help you back on track after identify theft when it comes to locking down accounts or issuing new identification. But after the initial storm has passed, you may experience long-term consequences of identity theftâ€”your personal data may be used to file fraudulent tax returns during the next calendar year, or even several years down the line. Cybercriminals may leverage your social security number to work in other states or obtain new credit services they never intend to pay back. As a result, you may encounter issues with credit or financing in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eMake sure to keep a keen eye on your credit reports beyond 90 days, and always flag anything fraudulent immediately. In some grave situations, you can also apply for a new \u003ca href=\"http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0248-do-you-need-new-social-security-number\"\u003esocial security number\u003c/a\u003e. Additionally, you should try to limit the amount of credit services you use to reduce the long-term impact of identity theft. With only one or two low-limit cards, any other activity will quickly be flagged as suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e4) Protect Your Future\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eAfter criminals have stolen your identity and used it to open fraudulent accounts or make large purchases, you may encounter legal difficulties. Often, defrauded companies will report their losses to private debt collectors, who will call you and your family members looking for the money owed for \"your\" purchases. In July of 2015, 31 percent of complaints made to the \u003ca href=\"http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201508_cfpb_monthly-complaint-report-vol-2.pdf\"\u003eConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\u003c/a\u003e were about debt collectors. Many of these collectors are aggressive. The FTC recommends writing a \u003ca href=\"https://www.identitytheft.gov/sample-letters/identity-theft-debt-collector.html\"\u003eletter\u003c/a\u003e explaining your situation and attaching any relevant correspondence, records, police and credit reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eSome credit card companies and retailers may try to hold you responsible for any charges made in your name if you don\u0027t act quickly enough after the fact. As a result, it\u0027s a good idea to contact card issuers, banks and other agencies as soon as you notice a theft and keep records of all relevant phone calls, letters and information requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003eIn addition to knowing how and when to react, it is important to take preventative measures: Safe Internet surfing habits, solid antivirus and Internet security solutions, effective passwords and limited credit sprawl. And while this all may sound a bit overwhelming, it pays to know what to do if your identity is stolen. The tips above can help mitigate the damage and help you get your life back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"more-interest\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"franklin\"\u003eOther articles and links related to online scams\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/threats/top-7-cyberthreats\" title=\"Top Cyberthreats\"\u003eTop Cyberthreats\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/threats/top-6-online-scams\" title=\"Top Online Scams\"\u003eTop Online Scams\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/threats/spam-phishing\" title=\"Spam and Phishing\"\u003eSpam and Phishing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/preemptive-safety/facebook\" title=\"Facebook Security\"\u003eFacebook Security\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/preemptive-safety/online-shopping\" title=\"Safer Online Shopping\"\u003eSafer Online Shopping\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/preemptive-safety/antivirus-choices\" title=\"Choosing an Antivirus Solution\"\u003eChoosing an Antivirus Solution\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/preemptive-safety/faq\" title=\"Internet Security FAQ\"\u003eInternet Security FAQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/preemptive-safety/kids-online-safety\" title=\"Keeping Kids Safe Online\"\u003eKeeping Kids Safe Online\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/threats/smartphones\" title=\"Smartphone Security Tips \"\u003eSmartphone Security Tips\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli class=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/resource-center/preemptive-safety/online-shopping\" title=\"Protecting Your Money Security Tips \"\u003eProtecting Your Money Security Tips\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","thumbnail_image":"content/ru-ru/images/repository/isc/2017-images/web-img-17.jpg","image":[],"category":[{"id":330399,"key":"2-2","title":"02::threats","description":"Treats"}],"subcategory":[{"id":330579,"key":"2-2-3","title":"web","description":"Web"}],"labels":[],"boost":0}}
