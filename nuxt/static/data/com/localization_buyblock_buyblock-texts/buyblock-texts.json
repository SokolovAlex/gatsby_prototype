Kaspersky Hybrid Cloud Security is a successor to Kaspersky Security for Virtualization product; its license grants rights for activation of (or – it contains?) both <a href=\"/small-to-medium-business-security/virtualization-agentless\">KSV Agentless</a> and <a href=\"/small-to-medium-business-security/virtualization-light-agent\">KSV Light Agent</a> – and more, to cover your needs for proven cybersecurity in physical, virtual and cloud space. If you’re already a Kaspersky Lab customer using Kaspersky Security for Virtualization, be assured that everything is ready for easy switching to Kaspersky Hybrid Cloud Security license.
